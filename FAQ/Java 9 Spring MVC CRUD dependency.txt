FAQ:  Maven can't find a class, but it is listed in the pom.xml

First, double-check that you have the correct Maven coordinates in the file (groupId, artifactId and version). Look for typos.

--

This could be caused by a corrupt local Maven repo. You can resolve it with these steps.

Option 1:



1. On your project, right-click: Maven > Update Project

2. In the dialog, check the box: Force Update of Snapshots/Releases

3. Click Ok

Maven will perform a rebuild.

If that doesn't solve your problem then move to option 2

Option 2:



1. Delete your local Maven repo, the .m2 directory on your computer

On MS Windows

either  
C:\Documents and Settings\<yourUserName>\.m2
c:\Users\<yourUserName>\.m2

On Mac/Linux

~/.m2

--

Note, on your OS, you may need to configure your OS to show hidden files.

2. Once .m2 directory is deleted, restart Eclipse

3. On your project, right-click: Maven > Update Project

This will resolve your issue.
