HEADS UP: New Spring Security 5.0.2  - deprecated method

The Spring Security team released Spring Security 5.0.2 on 20 Feb 2018.

They deprecated the method: User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder() 

We use this for the in-memory authentication section of the course.

This issue only applies to in-memory authentication.

But don't worry, this is okay for demo purposes (in-memory).

Later in the course we'll store user accounts in the database using encryption. As a result, this will be a non-issue (there are no deprecated methods for database storage).

In the following video, when you see a deprecation warning for, User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()  you can safely ignore it: because we are only using it for demo purposes.
